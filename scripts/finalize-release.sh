# Finalize a release with the artifacts that need the LOCAL signing keystore
# (which never goes into CI). After the release workflow has published the tag's
# GitHub Release (source tarball + unsigned .wgt + docker image), run this to:
#   1. build the SIGNED Android APK locally,
#   2. pull the CI-built unsigned .wgt back down from the release,
#   3. assemble a COMPLETE source tarball that bundles BOTH binaries
#      (extract it and LoopPlayer.apk sits at the root, ready for /download/apk),
#   4. upload the APK + the complete tarball to the release (replacing the
#      source-only tarball CI uploaded).
