/*
 * Pure-JavaScript image operations — the two things the ingest path ever asked sharp for:
 * measure an image, and write a thumbnail.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS THE WORK, NOT THE ENTRY POINT. Callers use ./image-ops, which runs these on a
 * worker thread; everything here is CPU-bound pure JS that would otherwise stall the event loop
 * for ~1s per 12MP photo. Requiring this module directly is only correct inside the worker (or in
 * image-ops' inline fallback). See ./image-ops for why.
 *
 * WHY NOT SHARP: sharp is a native module wrapping libvips. That costs us a prebuilt binary per
 * platform/ABI, and when there isn't one (or Node moves ABI) the failure is
 * ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED/NODE_MODULE_VERSION at require time — the same class of breakage
 * lib/preflight-deps.js exists to explain for better-sqlite3. Nothing in here is native, so the
 * server runs anywhere Node runs, including the embedded targets that have no toolchain.
 *
 * FORMAT COVERAGE vs the sharp it replaces:
 *   jpeg png gif tiff bmp   Jimp, natively
 *   webp avif               @jsquash/* — WebAssembly, bundled, no network (see wasmDecode below)
 *   svg                     never reaches here; callers thumbnail an SVG with itself
 *   heic                    unsupported — and it already was. sharp lists `heif`, but its
 *                           prebuilt libvips has AV1 only and refuses HEVC ("Unsupported
 *                           compression"), so .heic uploads have never produced a thumbnail.
 *
 * ORIENTATION (#170): Jimp applies EXIF orientation when it decodes and rewrites the tag to 1,
 * so what comes back is already DISPLAY dimensions — the rotation sharp needed an explicit
 * .rotate() for. metadata() therefore reports orientation 1 and lets imageDisplayDims() run as a
 * no-op rather than swapping W/H a second time. Report the tag honestly and that helper stays
 * correct for any future decoder that does NOT auto-orient.

 * bare "fetch failed". The binary IS on disk in the package — read and compile it ourselves, then
 * hand the Module to init(). No network, at install time or after.

 * Loop OS image compression: shrink the STORED asset to something a screen can actually use.
 *
 * A phone photo lands here at 12MP and 6MB to be shown on a 1080p panel. Downscaling to fit
 * 1920x1080 and re-encoding is the single biggest storage win available, and unlike video it is
 * cheap enough to do inline with the upload.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO, and why — the naive "re-encode everything as JPEG" loses real data:
 *
 *   animated GIF   skipped. Jimp re-encodes the FIRST FRAME only, so compressing one would
 *                  silently turn an animation into a still.
 *   webp / avif    skipped. Already modern codecs, usually smaller than the JPEG we would
 *                  produce, and @jsquash is imported decode-only so we cannot write them back.
 *   svg            never reaches here (it is its own thumbnail — see deriveMediaMetadata).
 *   transparency   kept as PNG. A logo or overlay re-encoded to JPEG gets an opaque black
 *                  background, which on a signage screen is a visibly broken asset.
 *
 * And it only ever replaces the original when the result is genuinely SMALLER: re-encoding an
 * already-optimised JPEG can easily produce a bigger file, and "compression" that grows the
 * library is worse than doing nothing.
